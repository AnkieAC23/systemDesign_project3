        <h2>About Your Fashion Diary</h2>
        <p>Welcome to Your Fashion Diary. This platform allows you to easily track and reflect on your daily outfits, helping you understand your style, preferences and fashion journey over time. <br>
        <br> To get started, simply create an account. Once signed in, you will be taken directly to your dashboard, where you can view your collection of existing fashion entries and create new ones. <br>
        <br> With each entry, you can record details such as the date, brand, occasion and give a rating. You can also add notes to reflect on how you felt in the outfit, what inspired the look or anything else you would like to remember. <br>
        <br> Your Fashion Diary is designed to document your outfits, capture the evolution of your personal style and provide a space for reflection. We hope it becomes a valuable tool for understanding your fashion journey.
